# Express app using best practices for security and performance

## Goal: 
Build and host a straightforward Express app using best practices in performance and security. Integrate with frontend and database. Document process and app.

### Express server
- routes
- middleware
- error and exception handling
- 

### Documentation process
- Technologies used
- how to build
- document the server and its implementation

### Performance best practices implementation
- Compression: utilize gzip and research
- Asynchronous over synchronous. Synchronous only on startup
- Propper logging
- handle exceptions properly


### Security best practices implementation
- How to be safe?
- Use most up to date versions
- Utilize TLS
- Do not trust user input. Sanatize input. prevent open redirects
- Utilize Helmet
- Prevent fingerprinting, which is the ability to find out what technologies and softwares the site is using
- Use cookies securely
- Prevent brute force against authorization
- dependency vulnerabilities. Use Snyck, npm audit, Node Security Project


### Front end
